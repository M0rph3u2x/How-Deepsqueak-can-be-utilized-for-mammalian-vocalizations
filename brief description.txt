
	DETECTION, CLASSIFICATION AND DENOISING NETWORKS
		BRIEF DESCRIPTION

DETECTION NETWORKS (detectors):

Three detector networks were trained and used for the study.

1) Elke_longcalls.mat: targeting long mouse lemur calls (trills and long whistles)

2) Elke_sw_tsaks.mat: targeting short mouse lemur calls (typically, short whistles and tsaks)

3) Elke_zips.mat: targeting very short mouse lemur calls (zips)

To enable the use of these detection networks on DeepSqueak, they need to be stored inside the 
"Networks" folder of the DeepSqueak folder.

USV Detection

CLASSIFICATION NETWORK (classifier):

called "ClassifierNet.mat", needs to be stored inside the "Clustering Models" folder of the
DeepSqueak folder. This network will automatically label the data according to five
common classes of mouse lemur tonal calls: long whistles, short whistles, tsaks, zips and trills

Supervised Classification

DENOISING NETWORK (denoiser)

Available under the name "CleaningNet.mat", this model automatically cleans up the data
removing unwanted signals. It was trained based on audio recordings from laboratory
experiments at our institute in Hannover.

The denoiser should be stored into "Denoising Networks" folder of the DeepSqueak folder

For details on how to use the denoising network please visit the DeepSqueak's Wiki (link below),
